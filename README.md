1D convection-diffusion equation solvers (in progress)
- with constant coefficients
- with time dependent coefficients
- with time and space dependent coefficinets
- with Dirac-delta initial value conditions
- with 2D time vs. space contour plotting

Using FiPy (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/index.html), SciPy (https://www.scipy.org/), NumPy (https://numpy.org/) and more.
