This folder contains plots of the numerical solution for different initial conditions and coefficients as well as the plots of the half-analytical solutions, which were calculated on the same time and space resolution as their numerical counterparts with the use of a numerical Dirac-delta function. 
Given the not fully analytical solution, the time and space resolution have a significant effect on both the numerical and the half-analytical solutions. 
In the lower resolution numerical solutions we can see a significant numerical diffusion as well, but around 10^4 by 10^4 resolutions, the difference between the numerical and analytical solution diminishes.
