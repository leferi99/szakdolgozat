- functions_without_generation.py contains functions for examining uniform distribution initial condition's and Dirac delta initial condition's time evolution with given transport coefficients
- functions_with_generation.py contains calling of a function from the Runaphys library at [OSREP/Runaphys](https://github.com/osrep/Runaphys), and also contains Dreicer generation and avalanche generation implementations alongside other functions which can use magnetic island data on a very basic level
