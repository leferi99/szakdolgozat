# Results obtained with the help of the Runaphys library

Filenames contain:
- the type of generation
- the resolution
- "withI" denotes that the calculations with the REs in magnetic islands were done separately

# A few select images
Dreicer generation with 0 RE density initial condition, avalanche generation with uniform density initial condition.

Avalanche generation 1000x1000 resolution - The generation is almost non-existent because the collision time is around 0.02s for the used parameters, and I only examine 0.001s in this plot.

0.1s Avalanche generation 100x100 resolution - Notice the small diffusion from the left edge is enough to make a difference regarding avalanche on this timescale.

0.01s Avalanche generation 100x100 resolution

0.1s examined time with 0.001 times the original transport coefficients, just to see the avalanche generation better.
